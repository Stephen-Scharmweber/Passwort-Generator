`A lightweight GUI application for generating and copying individual passwords, built with Python and Tkinter.`

## Features

- Generate random passwords with customizable length
- Toggle inclusion of numbers
- Toggle inclusion of special characters
- Customizable set of special characters
- One-click copy to clipboard
- Clean, simple interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

`1. Run the script: python password_generator.py
2. Configure your password:
   - LENGTH: Set password length (default: 9)
   - NUMBERS: Check to include numbers (0-9)
   - SPECIAL CHARS: Check to include special characters
   - Special chars field: Edit the special characters to use (default: !ยง$%&/()=?+*#-_.:,;<>+-)
3. Click "GENERATE PASSWORD"
4. Click "COPY PASS" to copy to clipboard`

## Customization

`You can modify the default values in the code:
- Change default length: length_entry.insert(0, "9")
- Change special characters: special_chars_entry.insert(0, r"!ยง$%&/()=?+*#-_.:,;<>+-")
- Adjust colors: overall_background_button = "#00008B"
- Modify fonts: overall_font = "Righteous", overall_font_size = "14"`

## How It Works

`1. Password generation uses:
   - Letters (always included)
   - Numbers (optional)
   - Special characters (optional)
2. Copy functionality:
   - Auto-generates if empty
   - Copies to clipboard
   - Shows confirmation`
